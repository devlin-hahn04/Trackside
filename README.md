🏎️ Trackside App 🏁

Trackside App is a user-based Flutter application that brings you the latest Formula 1 season data — including the World Drivers' Championship (WDC) and World Constructors' Championship (WCC) standings — right to your fingertips! 📱✨

🚀 How It Works:

      🐍 A Python web scraper runs automatically using GitHub Actions ⏰

      🌐 It scrapes the official F1 website for up-to-date WDC & WCC data

       🔄 The scraped data is converted into JSON format 📄

       ☁️ This JSON data is sent and stored in a Supabase project

      📲 The Trackside App fetches the data from Supabase and displays it beautifully in the app UI 🎨

🎯 Features:

    👤 User authentication (Sign Up, Login, Logout) powered by Supabase

    📊 Live season standings for Drivers & Constructors

    🔄 Automatic updates powered by continuous scraping and syncing

    🎨 Clean and responsive Flutter UI for a seamless user experience
